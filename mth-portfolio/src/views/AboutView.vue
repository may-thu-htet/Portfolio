      <p>
        I had finished my undergraduate degree in February,2015 and decided to
        study abroad. Therefore, I started to prepare the language skill
        required and then went to UK and attended post-gradurate master program
        at Newcastle University. After I have finished my graduation, I started
        working as a freelance Naval Architect. After a little while, I felt
        like I want to challenge more and decided to come to Japan to work as a
        design engineer as Toyota Kohki Co.,Ltd. I tried at the aforemensioned
        company and I even went to factory for training as I want to design the
        formwork from scratch. The following photos were taken when I went to
        the factory and trying to understand the assembly and welding process so
        that I can apply in design consideration.

        After a while, I am thinking about what I want to do in the future
        career and the result is that I want to deal with the creative design,
        implementing simple and artistic web app as well as moblie app. And
        hence I started learning basic HTML,CSS and JavaScript in October, 2011.
        From that, I moving to self-study UIUX design using Figma and design
        concept and I am really enjoying it. As my hobby is creating art and I
        have been doing painting and drawing since my childhood. I have drawn a
        lot of portraits, acrylic and watercolor paintings, modern paintings
        using acrylics, color pencils and pastels. Resently, I started learning
        digital drawing using Procreate App. I also want to learn paint using
        oil which is on my next basket list. The following pictures are some of
        my art works throughout my life until now.
